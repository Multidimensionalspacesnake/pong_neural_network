# Pong Neural Network
This repository contains the code for the game of PONG which was built from scratch and a neural network that learns to play the game and gets better overtime, with experience, on its own.

# LIBRARIES USED
The following libraries have to be installed on the system in order to run the code.

1. Tensorflow (www.tensorflow.org)
2. numpy
3. pygame
4. random
5. collections
6. Open-CV (https://www.solarianprogrammer.com/2016/09/17/install-opencv-3-with-python-3-on-windows/)

# HOW IT WORKS
There is a game of pong which was built from scratch and then I created a DQN (Deep Q Network). The DQN is a five layered convolutional neural network which takes game pixels and score as an input and trains on it and gets better in the game through TRIAL and ERROR.

# HOW TO RUN THE CODE
To run the code, open the terminal in the PONG NEURAL NETWORK directory which contains the python files. And run this command

```
python RL.py
```
